DeepMinds-Hackathon 🚀
📌 Overview
DeepMinds-Hackathon is an end-to-end automation project designed to streamline the software delivery pipeline.
From PBI creation in Azure DevOps to code generation, PR submission, documentation, and dashboard monitoring, our agent covers the full chain with human-in-the-loop validation for quality assurance.

🎯 Objectives
Automate the full lifecycle: PBI → Code → PR → Documentation → Dashboard.

Showcase seamless integration with GitHub and Azure DevOps.

Demonstrate autonomy while ensuring human validation for trust and security.

🛠️ Technical Approach
1. PBI Analysis
Agent reads PBIs from Azure DevOps.

Detects incomplete PBIs (missing criteria, vague descriptions).

Enriches them with acceptance criteria and detailed tasks.

Tools: Azure DevOps API + N8N orchestrator.

2. Code Generation
Agent consumes enriched PBIs.

Generates code using GitHub Copilot/API.

Creates a new branch and opens a PR automatically.

Tools: GitHub API + Copilot.

3. Documentation
Agent generates technical documentation (README, notes).

Attaches documentation to PR or PBI depending on definition of done.

Tools: GitHub API (PR comments, wiki).

✅ Validation Strategy
Human-in-the-loop:

PR created → Notification sent → Human review → If approved, agent continues.

Security:

Tokens scoped to user.

Logs maintained for traceability.

🖥️ Demonstration Flow
Create an incomplete PBI in Azure DevOps.

Agent enriches the ticket.

Agent generates code and opens a PR in GitHub.

Notification sent → Human review.

Upon validation, agent attaches documentation.

Dashboard auto-generated by agent shows success metrics.

📊 Dashboard Features
Success rate of completed PBIs.

Number of PRs generated.

Average human validation time.

Innovation: Dashboard generated autonomously by the agent.

🔧 Tools & Access
Azure DevOps → Source of PBIs.

GitHub → Code, PRs, documentation.

N8N → Workflow orchestration.

Tokens → Scoped to user.

Internal portal → Access requests.
